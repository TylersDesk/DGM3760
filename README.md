Repo for students to get comfortable with git and Node.js.

*Be sure you have a github account. You will need one to turn assignments in for the class*

Bonus points for anyone finding my typos, fixing them, and creating a pull request for them. Bonus points will only be giving via the pull request.

## Exercise 1 - Git Basics

In this assignment we will be getting comfortable with checking out repos, switching branches, creating branches and committing code. As well as creating issues.

#### First - Create Issue

Create an issue in this repo requesting access. I will demonstrate in class.

#### Practice switch branches

`git checkout <branchname>`
`git checkout dev`
`git checkout master`
